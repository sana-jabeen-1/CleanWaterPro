    description:
      "Yes, water from a water softener is safe for most household uses, including drinking, cooking, and cleaning. At Clean Water Pro’s, as an authorized dealer of the Westinghouse Dynamic Series, we ensure our water filtration systems not only soften water, but also refine and purify it to meet the highest safety standards. Water softeners work by replacing hard water minerals, such as calcium and magnesium, with sodium or potassium ions. This reduces scale buildup in pipes and appliances while enhancing water’s overall quality. Combined with advanced filtration technology, our systems effectively remove harmful impurities, ensuring every drop in your home is crystal clear and safe. If you have specific health concerns or dietary restrictions related to sodium intake, we also offer tailored solutions like reverse osmosis systems to further purify your softened water. Our mission is to provide water that supports a healthy lifestyle for your entire household.",
